\chapter{Introduction}
%TODO write introduction
Recommendation systems are systems that aim to make personalized content recommendations to its users.
They are widely used in the world wide web in different contexts such as movie recommendation in the streaming service Netflix or music recommendation as in last.fm as well as in e-commerce to recommend products that the user might purchase.
They seek to provide users with items that are new to them or they might not have discovered otherwise.

While in the context of Netflix or last.fm the users actively search for new movies or music and intentionally use the recommendation system, in the context of e-commerce recommendations are usually shown while browsing the website.
This also reflects in the kind of input the users give to the recommendation system.
In systems like Netflix and last.fm the users give explicit feedback to different items in the form of ratings to express how much a user likes an item or by simply stating whether the user likes or dislikes an item.
E-commerce services in contrast need to derive user preferences from their purchase or browsing behaviour.
This kind of feedback is called implicit feedback.

Moreover the available datasets vary in number of users, number of items and amount of sparseness.
The success of a specific recommendation technique depends on the available data.
So for a specific dataset a suitable recommendation algorithm need to be found. %TODO find reference to prove that different datasets need different techniques
In this thesis different algorithms will be investigated to find a suitable technique for product recommendation in e-commerce.
%TODO find a dataset with more items than users (I think in handbook was news dataset was mentioned)
%TODO add reference to further chapter where I will explain in more detail which techniques work well for which datasets

A general challenge for recommendation is the high dimensionality and sparseness of the data.
Usually there is a high amount of users and items, but a single user only interacts with a relatively small amount of items and many items are only considered by a small amount of users.
% TODO how is this relevant for my thesis? fast recommendation are more difficult



%todo eventually add more details about implicit feedback 
%todo could add that there are interactive systems or configarionable ones
%todo also could add different requirements from the handbook


\section{Problem statement}
%TODO write problem statment section
What is my specific task?
my recommender system should serve different online shops / should work for different data
since different techniques perform different on different datasets I first need to investigate which techniques to use.
so first find how single recommenders perform and how they can be combined
I need the recommender system to automatically tune for different datasets.
general description of data (binary, implicit, sparse, purchases, views, shop cart entries, ...)

\section{Contribution}
%TODO write contribution section
What is novel in my thesis?
What is the specific challenge? (e-commerce seems to have different requirements (sarwar has different results for e-commerce and movielens data), implicit/binary data, no negative preferences, should work for multiple sets)

\section{Related work}

\chapter{Recommender Systems}
There are different types of recommendation systems.
They can be divided into collaborative filtering (CF), content-based (CB), demographic, knowledge-based or network-based recommenders. % TODO add reference
The most important ones are collaborative filtering and content-based recommenders.% TODO why are they most important
These techniques are applied for the recommendation system developed in the scope of this thesis and will be addressed in the next two sections.
In section \ref{rs_others} the other mentioned techniques will be shortly introduced to complete the picture of possible recommendation techniques.

\section{Collaborative filtering}
\label{rs_cf}
%TODO write CF chapter
Collaborative filtering is the most implemented and successful recommendation technique. %TODO add reference
Recommendations are made based on the preferences of all users using their ratings in the context of netflix or their purchases in an e-commerce context.
These information is represented a matrix where users a represented as rows and columns represent the items.
Every matrix entry indicates the interaction of a specific user-item pair.
For e-commerce data there is an entry of 1 indicating preference for every item a user purchased.
The other entries remain empty or zero indicating that preference for these items are unknown. %TODO maybe write an own chapter for data representation and put this there

Collaborative filtering techniques are divided again into two different approaches: memory-based and model-based approaches.
While memory-based approaches directly make use of the preference matrix, model-based approaches train an alternative model and use this to make calculate recommendation.
Model-based recommendation needs some time to train the model, but are able to make faster recommendations because the full purchase matrix does not need to be taken into account, but the more compact model can be used.
Moreover model-based techniques usually need less memory, because the full purchase matrix is not needed.

In this thesis two memory-based and one model-based approach was investigated.
The memory-based techniques are nearest-neighbour algorithms applied on the purchase matrix.
%TODO describe item-item and user-user
%TODO advantaged and drawbacks of those 
%TODO what are actual differences?
%TODO find paper where those are applied or at least similiary applied and how mine version is different

%TODO describe svd in general
%TODO why do usual approaches not work on implicit feedback
%TODO mention svd on implicit feedback papers and why they are not applicable
%TODO what are my solutions for the problems (reference to boosting chapter)
